Further, genetic studies suggest a possible earlier human diaspora contributing a small percentage to their ancestry and potential interbreeding with Denisovans. While their genetic history reveals a long period of isolation, particularly after rising sea levels separated Australia from New Guinea and surrounding islands, there's evidence of a population split and divergence within the Australasian group, with Aboriginal Australians and Papuans diverging roughly 37,000 years ago.\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\nFrom the search results, I can see that genetic research has inferred a date of habitation for Aboriginal Australians as early as 43,000 and 60,000 years ago.\n\nTherefore, the mulga apple is often eaten by people who genetic research has inferred a date of habitation as early as when 43,000 and 60,000 years ago.</think>\n\n <answer> 43,000 and 60,000 years ago </answer>"}
