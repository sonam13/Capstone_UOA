While the SR-71 relied on speed, the SR-72 aims to combine speed with advanced materials and a combined cycle engine capable of reaching Mach 6.  This engine would integrate a turbine engine for lower speeds with a scramjet for hypersonic flight.  The extreme temperatures generated at such speeds necessitate the use of composite materials similar to those used in ICBMs and the Space Shuttle.  Lockheed Martin has been collaborating with Aerojet Rocketdyne on engine development, exploring technologies like a dual-mode ramjet to bridge the gap between turbine and scramjet operation.  Although a smaller demonstrator was initially planned, current focus seems to be on a full-scale reusable vehicle, with a potential prototype flight by 2025 and possible service entry in the 2030s.\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\nThe search results mention that the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird used composite materials similar to those used in ICBMs and the Space Shuttle.\n\nTherefore, the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft mostly made out of is composite materials.</think>\n\n<answer> Composite materials </answer>"}
