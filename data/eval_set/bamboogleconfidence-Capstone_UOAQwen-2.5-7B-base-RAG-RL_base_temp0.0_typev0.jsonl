Over the following decades, superconductivity was observed in other materials like lead, niobium, and niobium nitride, each with different critical temperatures.  The development of the BCS theory in 1957 provided a microscopic explanation of superconductivity, describing it as a superfluid of electron pairs. While early attempts to utilize superconductivity in electromagnets were hampered by the destructive effects of magnetic fields, advancements in materials science have led to the creation of powerful supermagnets using niobium-tin and niobium-titanium alloys, vital for technologies like MRI and particle accelerators.
