Designed for flight at over Mach 3, this two-person aircraft utilized specialized technologies, including a radar-reducing shape and advanced materials like titanium and polymer composites. Its Pratt & Whitney J58 engines, coupled with a unique inlet and ejector nozzle design, allowed the Blackbird to reach record-breaking speeds and operate at altitudes of 80,000 feet.  To handle the extreme conditions, the aircraft required specialized fuel (JP-7), a complex astro-inertial navigation system, and protective pressurized suits for the crew.

Constructed primarily of titanium, the A-12 required innovative production techniques and the use of radar-absorbing composite materials to minimize its radar cross-section.  The aircraft's development involved extensive testing at Groom Lake, including the use of specialized fuel additives to reduce the visibility of its afterburner plumes.
