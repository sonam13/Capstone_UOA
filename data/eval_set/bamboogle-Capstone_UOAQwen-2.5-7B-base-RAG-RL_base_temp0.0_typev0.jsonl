During its flyby, Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, bringing the total known at the time to 15.  The probe also studied Uranus's atmosphere and unique ring system, finding two new rings.  Voyager 2's instruments revealed important data about the planet's magnetic field, radiation belts, and the diverse geology of its moons, including Miranda, which exhibited surprisingly complex surface features.\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\nFrom the search results, I can see that the first spacecraft to approach Uranus was NASA's Voyager 2.\n\n**Step 2: Determine which rocket that spacecraft was launched on.**\n\nI'll use a query to search for information about the rocket that launched Voyager 2:\n\n<|begin_of_query|> rocket that launched Voyager 2<|end_of_query|>\n\n<|begin_of_documents|>\nLaunched on August 20, 1977, Voyager 2's primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter, Saturn, with the possibility of extending its journey to Uranus and Neptune.  While its twin, Voyager 1, focused on Saturn's moon Titan, Voyager 2's trajectory allowed for a potential visit to the ice giants if Voyager 1 was successful. Equipped with a variety of scientific instruments, a powerful communication system, and radioisotope thermoelectric generators for long-term power, Voyager 2 was designed for the long haul. After a launch aboard a Titan IIIE/Centaur, the spacecraft embarked on its Grand Tour, encountering Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1981.  Despite a scan platform malfunction after its Saturn encounter, Voyager 2 continued on to Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989, marking a successful completion of its primary mission.\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\nFrom the search results, I can see that Voyager 2 was launched aboard a Titan IIIE/Centaur rocket.\n\nTherefore, the rocket that the first spacecraft that ever approached Uranus was launched on is the Titan IIIE/Centaur.</think>\n\n <answer> Titan IIIE/Centaur </answer>"}
