This was made possible by a rare planetary alignment and the use of gravity assists.  While Voyager 1 focused primarily on Saturn's moon Titan, Voyager 2's trajectory allowed for a backup Titan flyby if Voyager 1 failed, ultimately prioritizing the ice giants. Voyager 2 successfully completed flybys of Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981, Uranus in 1986, and Neptune in 1989.  The probe is now in its extended mission, studying the interstellar medium and has entered interstellar space, providing valuable data on this unexplored region.\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\n </think>\n\n <answer> Titan </answer>"}

Renamed Voyager due to significant design changes, the probe followed a shorter trajectory than its twin, Voyager 2, allowing it to reach Jupiter and Saturn sooner.  Its journey included a close flyby of Jupiter in March 1979, revealing active volcanoes on Io and providing detailed images of the gas giant's moons and rings.  Voyager 1 then encountered Saturn in November 1980, studying its atmosphere, rings, and the moon Titan, the latter observation deemed so crucial that the probe's trajectory was designed around it. After its planetary encounters, Voyager 1 continued its mission, eventually becoming the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space in August 2012, a milestone confirmed in 2013.\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\nThe search results mention that Voyager 2 was launched on September 5, 1977.\n\nNow, I'll use a query to search for information about the rocket that launched Voyager 2 on September 5, 1977:\n\n<|begin_of_query|> rocket that launched Voyager 2 on September 5, 1977<|end_of_query|>\n\n<|begin_of_documents|>\nVoyager 1, launched on September 5, 1977, leveraged gravity assist maneuvers around Jupiter and Saturn to gain enough energy to escape the Sun's gravitational pull.  This technique, also known as a gravitational slingshot, uses a planet's gravity to alter a spacecraft's speed and trajectory, saving significant amounts of propellant.  While Voyager 1 used this method to gain speed and escape the Solar System,  gravity assists can also be used to decrease a spacecraft\u2019s speed, as demonstrated by Mariner 10 and MESSENGER on their missions to Mercury.\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\n </think>\n\n <answer> Titan IIIE </answer>"}
